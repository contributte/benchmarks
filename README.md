# PHP benchmarks

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/contributte.png?size=200">

The goal of this repository is to measure speed!

- which database library is fastest?
- which process manager is faster PHP-FPM, PHP-PM?
- which webserver is faster Nginx, Nginx Unit, Apache or Cadddy?
- which extension is faster Swoole or OpenSwoole?
- which framework is faster RoadRunner or ReactPHP?

Do you want to talk about it? Reach me at [@f3l1x](https://github.com/f3l1x) ([f3l1x.io](https://f3l1x.io)).

## Scenario

- [DBAL](/dbal) - measure speed of DBAL's and ORM's
- [HTTP](/http) - measure speed of PHP frameworks and extensions (WIP)
